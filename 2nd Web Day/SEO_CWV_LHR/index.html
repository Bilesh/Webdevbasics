      <p>
        GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and
        collaborative software development. It allows developers to host and
        review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of
        other developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        GitHub provides a range of features including repositories for code
        storage, issue tracking, pull requests for code review, and a social
        networking aspect that allows users to follow each other and contribute
        to projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is widely used in the open-source community and has become a standard
        tool for software development teams around the world. GitHub supports
        Git, a version control system that tracks changes in code, making it
        easier for multiple developers to work on the same project without
        conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        GitHub also offers additional features such as GitHub Actions for
        continuous integration and deployment, GitHub Pages for hosting static
        websites, and GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool.
