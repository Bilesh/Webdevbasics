        The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow across the
        quiet town. Birds fluttered through the sky, their silhouettes dancing
        against the fading light. In the distance, childrenâ€™s laughter echoed as
        they played their final games before bedtime. A gentle breeze rustled
        the leaves of old oak trees lining the streets, whispering secrets only
        the night could understand. As lights flickered on in cozy homes, the
        scent of dinner drifted through the air, wrapping the neighborhood in a
        comforting embrace of familiarity and peace.

ðŸŒ™ Whispers of the Night ðŸŒ™

Beneath the veil of twilight's grace,
The stars awaken, soft embrace.
A silver hush, the moonlightâ€™s sigh,
Spills dreams across the velvet sky.

The flowers bow in duskâ€™s caress,
Nightâ€™s lullaby in gentleness.
A breeze so tender finds its way,
Through silent trees where shadows play.

Each heartbeat hums a secret tune,
Beneath the quiet watch of moon.
And though the world may rest its light,
The soul finds wings within the night.

So close your eyes and let it beâ€”
A dance with stars, a dream set free.
For beauty lives in hush and glow,
Where only hearts and starlight go.</pre

        In pre tag the document or the things written looks same as its written
        as shown in above example. Also we have used inline css thus its looking
        pretty.
