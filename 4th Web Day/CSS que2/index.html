      <h1>Question:</h1>
      Write HTML and CSS code to style a paragraph inside a div which contains 5
      other paragraphs. The first paragraph must have background-color yellow
      and color red, while the rest of the paragraphs should have
      background-color blue and color white. No using class or id selectors.
    </header>
    <main>
      <span
        ><hr />
        This is the Solution output:
      </span>
      <div>
        <p>
          This is a simple HTML document with a paragraph inside a div. The
          paragraph has an ID of "text". You can style this paragraph using CSS
          by targeting the ID selector #text.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also add more content here. This is a second paragraph that
          provides additional information. You can use CSS to style this
          paragraph as well, or you can leave it as is.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a third paragraph. You can continue to add more content as
          needed. Each paragraph can be styled individually or collectively
          using CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a fourth paragraph. You can use this space to provide more
          details or explanations about the content of your document.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a fifth paragraph. Feel free to add as many paragraphs as you
          need to convey your message effectively.
